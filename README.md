# Tic Tac Toe – C++ Console Game

A simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game written in C++ as part of my 12th‑grade informatics certification project. The program allows two players to compete, choose markers, track moves, and restart the game easily.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay (Player 1 vs Player 2)  
- Marker selection (X or O)  
- Input validation for occupied or invalid slots  
- Automatic board reset for new games  
- Move history tracking  
- Clear console interface (supports Windows, Linux, and Mac with minor adjustments)

## How It Works
- The board is represented as a 3×3 matrix  
- Players take turns choosing a slot (1–9)  
- The game checks for:
  - Row matches  
  - Column matches  
  - Diagonal matches  
- The game ends when:
  - A player wins  
  - All slots are filled (tie)

## Technologies Used
- C++  
- Standard input/output  
- Arrays and basic control structures  

## Purpose
This project was created to demonstrate:
- Understanding of algorithms  
- Clean procedural programming  
- Console UI logic  
- Problem-solving and debugging skills
